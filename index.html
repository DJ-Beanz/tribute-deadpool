        <h2>Why Deadpool deserves a tribute (besides the katanas)</h2>
        <p>
          Wade Wilson, a.k.a. Deadpool, is a regenerating degenerate with a
          healing factor, dual katanas, and the uncanny ability to know he’s in
          a web page. He’s chaotic good… on days ending with “y.” Despite the
          snark and snack obsessions, he occasionally saves the day between
          bites of chimichangas.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Breaks the fourth wall so often it’s basically a sliding door.
          </li>
          <li>Healing factor: paper cuts fear him; explosions annoy him.</li>
          <li>Katanas sharper than his jokes (debatable).</li>
          <li>
            Team-ups range from X-Force to “whoever’s nearby and not already
            running.”
          </li>
          <li>PhD in Maximum Effort; minor in Poor Life Choices.</li>
        </ul>

          “Life is an endless series of train-wrecks with only brief,
          commercial-like breaks of happiness.”
